This is a project called "Flight Booker" from the full stack Ruby on Rails curriculum from The Odin Project. You can find the project here: https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/building-advanced-forms.

The main focus of this assignment is setting up advanced forms in rails, but there's plenty of opportunity to hone my skills with Active Record associations, etc.
